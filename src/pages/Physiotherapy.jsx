          <p className="top-para">
            The Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation at Evan
            Healthcare is one of the largest chains of tertiary level
            rehabilitation centres in North India, with presence in Delhi NCR
            (Saket, Patparganj, Vaishali, Shalimar Bagh, Panchsheel Park,
            Greater Noida, Gurgaon & Noida) and Dehradun. Each of the institutes
            is designed to offer the highest levels of patient care in the field
            of physiotherapy and rehabilitation. The department is an important
            aspect of Evan Healthcare, helping patients gain back their
            independence after a disabling disease or a traumatic injury.
            Specialists in this area work with patients to help minimise the
            physical and cognitive effects of disability so that patients may
            reach their fullest potential.

            Depending upon an individual's medical and emotional condition and
            personal goals, patients may experience a number of benefits as a

            <li>The ability to return to work</li>
            <li>
              The ability to develop the skills necessary for independent
              living. Without such care, many of these patients would otherwise
              require long-term home care.

          <p className="top-para">
            The Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation is a one-stop
            destination for all types of physiotherapy and rehabilitative
            treatments. A physiotherapist or an occupational therapist completes
            a thorough assessment that may include the patient's health history,
            evaluation of pain and movement patterns, range of motion, strength,
            reflexes, sensation and cardio-respiratory status. They also examine
            relevant x-rays, laboratory tests, medical records and surgical
            notes. Based on this assessment, the therapist develops a diagnosis
            and works in partnership with the patient to plan individualised
            goals and treatment programs. This the department offers via the
            following services:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation</li>
            <p>
              The department has a Cardiac Rehabilitation Program that helps
              patients with various cardiac conditions to achieve optimal
              physical function. It includes an evaluation of the patient,
              exercise, education, counselling, risk factor modification and
              learning ways to live a healthier life. The program is a safe and
              effective way to help patients recover faster, get stronger,
              reduce stress, decrease the risks of future heart problems, and
              live longer.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>Geriatric care (Prevention of falls)</li>
            <p>
              More than one-third of the elderly population (ages 65 and older)
              fall each year. Nowadays, many senior citizens imprison themselves
              in their homes due to fear of falling. They lose the physical
              benefits of normal activity and compromise balance and muscle
              strength, putting themselves at an even greater risk. Impaired
              vision or mental functioning as a result of medication are other
              risk factors. <br />
              The department's geriatric care programme offers senior patients
              with a number of benefits. The physiotherapists devise a
              personalised treatment programme to help patients regain their
              independence, maximise safety, reducing the risk of falling,
              restoring their confidence, helping them carry out daily
              activities, improving mobility indoors and outdoors, maintaining
              their muscle strength, providing balance and walking re-education
              and improving quality of life, overall.

          <ul className="list-style">
            <li>Dysphagia management</li>
            <p>
              The Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation has expertise
              and experience in treating dysphagia (swallowing problems) caused
              by various diseases, especially dysphagia followed by a stroke.
              The treatment chosen depends on the patient's condition and nature
              of the problem. Difficulty in swallowing caused by motility
              disorders is treated by stretching narrowed passages. While
              dysphagia caused by neurological problems such as Alzheimer's or
              Parkinson's disease, stroke or spinal cord injury requires
              treating the underlying condition. In many cases, the doctors here
              use VitalStim Therapy (an electrical stimulation therapy) for the
              treatment of dysphagia. It helps in correcting dysphagia at early
              stages of the condition, prevents its progression to the point
              where the patient may require a feeding tube and enables many
              patients on tubes to return to normal or partly-normal eating.

            <li>Rehabilitation for neurological disorders</li>
            <p>
              The department's staff focuses on the restoration of function in
              people with a wide range of disabling injuries and illnesses.
              Therapists deal not only with the physical aspects of injury or
              disease but also the person's social, emotional and vocational
              wellbeing. Their practice of physiotherapy and rehabilitation is
              based on a holistic and comprehensive approach to medical care for
              individuals who have experienced an impairment resulting from an
              injury, disease process or developmental disorders.

              Neurological Rehabilitation programs are conducted on both,
              inpatient and outpatient cases. A dedicated neurological
              rehabilitation team revolves around patients and their families,
              helping them set short and long-term treatment goals for recovery.

            <li>Managing sports injuries</li>
            <p>
              Most sports injuries (muscle strains, ligament sprains, bruises,
              etc.) are caused by the overuse/misuse of a muscle or joint.
              However, there are preventive methods that can significantly
              reduce the risk of injury. The physiotherapists at the Department
              of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation help people of all ages and
              lifestyles gain their desired level of active living and physical
              functioning. With their applied knowledge and understanding of the
              human body in action, they are able to help sports enthusiasts
              increase mobility, relieve pain, build strength and improve
              balance and cardiovascular function. The physiotherapists not only
              treat injuries but also teach how to prevent the onset of pain or
              injury that can limit one's activity.

          <h4 className="first-heading">Why choose Evan Healthcare?</h4>

          <p className="top-para">
            Evan Healthcare has long held that the needs of the patient come
            first. This belief is evidenced in the patient-centred care offered
            by the Department of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. It is
            committed to providing patient care through teamwork. Throughout the
            duration of treatment at Evan Healthcare, patients receive the
            attention and care of a closely coordinated group of rehabilitation
            specialists, each of whom brings unique expertise to the team.

          <p className="top-para">
            Disabling diseases and traumatic injuries affect each patient
            differently. Accordingly, the doctors here deliver comprehensive
            treatment through personal and individualised care that considers
            the unique needs, abilities and objectives of each patient. The goal
            is to help patients help themselves. The department recognises that
            physiotherapy and rehabilitation patients are not passive
            recipients, but active participants in their own recovery.
            Accordingly, patients' families and the department's staff work
            together to set and follow individualised treatment plans for
            recovery. When implementing these treatment plans, patients benefit
            greatly from Evan's low patient-to-therapist ratio. In most
            instances, patients work one-on-one with their therapists. They also
            benefit from Evan's extensive array of patient care resources,
            including state-of-the-art medical equipment.
          </p>
          <p className="top-para">
            Evan Healthcare also believes that patient education is an important
            part of delivering excellent medical care. The Department of
            Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation staff weaves patient education
            opportunities into its daily rehabilitation activities. During these
            teaching moments, doctors use one-on-one discussions and teaching
            materials to educate patients about their medical condition and
            rehabilitative care.
