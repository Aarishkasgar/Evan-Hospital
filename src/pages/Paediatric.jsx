          <p className="top-para">
            Paediatrics is a specialised field of medicine dedicated to the
            physical, emotional, and developmental health of children from birth
            through adolescence. It covers a broad range of services, from
            preventive care to the diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic
            conditions in infants, toddlers, school-age children, and teenagers.

          <p className="top-para">
            A paediatrician is a medical expert trained to address the unique
            healthcare needs of children. In addition to treating illnesses,
            they closely monitor a child’s growth, development, and behaviour,
            helping parents navigate every stage of their child’s life. Their
            role includes:
