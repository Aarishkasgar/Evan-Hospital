            <h3>What is the difference between Obstetrics and Gynaecology?</h3>
            <p className="top-para">
              Obstetrics focuses on the care of pregnant women, including
              prenatal care, childbirth, and postnatal care for both mother and
              baby. Gynaecology, on the other hand, deals with the diagnosis and
              treatment of conditions related to the female reproductive system,
              including menstrual disorders, gynaecological cancers,
              infertility, and pelvic floor disorders.
            </p>
            <h3>Do gynaecologists deliver babies?</h3>
            <p className="top-para">
              Yes, some gynaecologists specialise in obstetrics and are trained
              to provide prenatal care, manage labour and delivery, and provide
              postpartum care for both mother and baby.
            </p>
            <h3>Can a gynaecologist do surgery?</h3>
            <p className="top-para">
              Yes, gynaecologists are trained to perform various surgical
              procedures related to the female reproductive system, including
              hysterectomy, myomectomy, ovarian cystectomy, tubal ligation, and
              minimally invasive surgeries such as laparoscopy and hysteroscopy.
            </p>
            <h3>When would I need to see an obstetrician?</h3>
            <p className="top-para">
              You would need to see an obstetrician if you are pregnant or
              planning to become pregnant, as obstetricians specialise in
              providing prenatal care, managing labour and delivery, and
              overseeing postnatal care for both mother and baby.
            </p>
            <h3>What is the most common gynaecological disease?</h3>
            <p className="top-para">
              It's difficult to pinpoint a single most common gynaecological
              disease as various conditions affect women at different rates and
              life stages. However, some frequently encountered issues include:
            </p>
            <li>
              Vaginal infections: Yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, and
              sexually transmitted infections are common concerns.
            </li>
            <li>
              Endometriosis: This condition involves the growth of endometrial
              tissue outside the uterus, causing pain and other symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>
              Uterine fibroids: These are non-cancerous growths in the uterus
              that can cause heavy bleeding, pelvic pain, and other issues.
            </li>
            <li>
              Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): This hormonal imbalance can lead
              to irregular periods, infertility, and other complications.
            </li>
            <h3>What are the 5 gynaecological cancers?</h3>
            <p className="top-para">
              The five main gynaecological cancers are:
            </p>
            <li>
              Cervical cancer: Affects the cervix, the lower part of the uterus.
            </li>
            <li>

              symptoms.
            </li>
            <li>Endometrial cancer: Starts in the lining of the uterus.</li>
            <li>Vaginal cancer: Rare cancer affecting the vagina.</li>
            <li>Vulvar cancer: Affects the outer vulva area.</li>

            <h3>
              If I have a vaginal infection or a urinary tract infection (UTI),
              what should I do?
            </h3>
            <p className="top-para">
              If you suspect you have a vaginal infection or UTI, it's essential
              to see a healthcare provider, such as a gynaecologist or primary
              care physician, for evaluation and treatment. They can perform
              tests to diagnose the infection and prescribe appropriate
              medications to treat it. Prompt treatment is important to prevent
              complications and alleviate symptoms.
            </p>
